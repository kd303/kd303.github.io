# HTTP2/GRPC based Patterns

## Why http2 over http 1.1 ##

### Web Performance ###

A detailed control available to developers over content prioritization. Which peiece of content to load first is controlled via **weighted prioritization**.
via multiplexing server sends the content over multiple data streams, each stream has different weighted value, value tells the client which one to render first. 
This works great for content serving - 

*need to see whether there would be any benifits for application/services*. Same strict origin issues causes 
*multiplexing the content, may cause issues at load-balancer or server side, if there are too many stream requests are recieved and it is not handled. 
With http 1.1 this way easier to manage/maintain and test*

### Server push ### 

Multiple modes of pushing the content to client - via Push promise etc. This could be an important aspect for some of services which are pushing only application content for tickers etc. 

### Persistant Connection ###

Due to persistent connections removing the need to consistantly create/close connections as HTTP/1.1 does.

## [GRPC](https://grpc.io/) ##

### Obvious advantages ###
 - Compact protocol, payload is protobuff and http2, makes the data exchange faster
 - Protobuf are way smaller than JSONs/Text for payloads, due to its binary format as well as usage of tags instead of "keys"
 - Better documentation and code evolution - due to CORBA like IDL interface definitions
 - Header compression wrt http
 - Auto code generation and cross language compatibility (not really an advantage **over** REST)
 
 ### Drawbacks ###
 - Due to persistant connections the http1.1 based load-balancer makes it difficult to route the requests like traditional http/1.1
   - Requires a L7 (application level) load-balancer due to client connection unlike L3/L4 for http1.1 which works at TCP level which would use more resources, adds latecy
   - **[Solutions](https://grpc.io/blog/grpc-load-balancing/)**
     - *Client Side load balancing* - complex client code, per-lanaguge implementation of client side code, trust
     - *Proxy laod balancing* - works well for end-users due to no knowledge required for back-end servers
     - *Look aside load-balancing* - just implement a server which returns appropriate server to communicate for clients [[Zookeepr](https://github.com/makdharma/grpc-zookeeper-lb/tree/master/examples/src/main/resources/io/grpc/examples) /etcd/consul/Eureka/[Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/upstream/service_discovery#arch-overview-service-discovery-types-eds)]
     - Side Car Pattern: Use a Envoy container as a side car proxy to do service discovery.
 - Use of protobuf means, difficult to debug, 
    - Keeping schema [backward and forward compatibility](/schema/schema-design.md)
    - Not readable using browsers, use of binary protocol makes it hard to read the payload
    - Communication to - fro - JSON based web-service becomes tidious
      - Solution(s) 
        - Use side-car proxy pattern - use something like [gRPC-transcoder filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.5.0/configuration/http_filters/grpc_json_transcoder_filter)
        - Use [gRPC-Web filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.5.0/configuration/http_filters/grpc_web_filter) to communicate with webclient
        - Use [gRPC HTTP/1.1 bridge](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.5.0/configuration/http_filters/grpc_http1_bridge_filter) - bridge http 1.1 client with gRPC content
 

## Good use-cases ##

- Microservices which are intra-communication
- Infrastructure releated metric colletion
- Maynot be great for client facing??

### Notes on Pending items to explore ###:

- Need to explore further on [Desync](https://portswigger.net/research/http2) attacks
