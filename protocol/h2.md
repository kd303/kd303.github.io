## Why http2 over http 1.1

### Web Performance ### : 
A detailed control available to developers over prioritization. Which peiece of content to load first is controlled via **weighted prioritization**.
via multiplexing server sends the content over multiple data streams, each stream has different weighted value, value tells the client which one to render first. 
This works great for content serving - 

*need to see whether there would be any benifits for application/services*. Same strict origin issues causes 
*multiplexing the content, may cause issues at load-balancer or server side, if there are too many stream requests are recieved and it is not handled. 
With http 1.1 this way easier to manage/maintain and test*

### Server push ### 

Multiple modes of pushing the content to client - via Push promise etc. This could be an important aspect for some of services which are pushing only application content 
for tickers etc.
