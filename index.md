## A generic site on Microservice and related Architecture issues

A generic site to document my thoughst on architecture issues. 

### Key Concerns

1. Protocols  (Http2, Json/HTTP, gRPC, Thrift, Avro - and issues around that)
2. Service Mesh  (Why, what problems does it solve, issues)
3. Kubernetes Design Concerns (DNS resolution, storage, Policy Governance, logging/tracing)
4. Patterns of Services (Request/response, Event Driven)
5. Schema Design issues (Backward/Forward compatibility)
6. Tooling (Various Frameworks - I came across and my understanding)
7. Security (Certificates, Secrets, RBAC, Data Security/Authroization)
8. Resiliancy, load-balancing, failures
