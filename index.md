## A collection on Microservice and related Architecture issues

At best these are my musing on Microservice architecture and core issues that affects that needs to be thought through before the designing something useful. By no means this is a complete list, these are the things that caught my eye.

### Key Concerns

1. [Protocols](/protocol/h2.md)  (Http2, Json/HTTP, gRPC, REST, Open API)
2. Service Mesh  (Why, what problems does it solve, issues)
3. [Container Design Concerns (DNS resolution, storage, Policy Governance, logging/tracing)](/k8s/.)
4. Patterns of Services (Request/response, Event Driven)
5. Schema Design issues (Backward/Forward compatibility)
6. Tooling (Various Frameworks - I came across and my understanding)
7. Security (Certificates, Secrets, RBAC, Data Security/Authroization)
8. Resiliancy, load-balancing, failures
9. [DevOPS](./devops/index.md)
